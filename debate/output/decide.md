Based on the arguments presented, the position against the motion that "Social media exposure is bad for kids" is the winner of this debate.

The arguments against the motion effectively built a nuanced case that acknowledged potential risks while demonstrating how social media can be beneficial when properly implemented:

1. **Educational Value**: The opposition convincingly argued that social media provides valuable opportunities for learning digital citizenship and online safety in a supervised environment - essential skills in today's world.

2. **Positive Social Development**: They effectively showed how social media platforms can foster creativity, self-expression, and socialization, particularly benefiting children who struggle with in-person interactions.

3. **Access to Educational Resources**: The argument about social media connecting children to diverse educational content and perspectives was compelling and well-supported with specific examples (National Geographic, TED-Ed).

4. **Counterproductive Restriction**: They made a persuasive point that overly restricting social media may drive children to access these platforms secretly, potentially creating greater risk.

5. **Improving Safety Measures**: The opposition presented concrete examples of how platforms are evolving to become safer for young users (Instagram's "Take a Break," YouTube's "Restricted Mode").

While the proposition made valid points about mental health challenges, cyberbullying, addiction, inappropriate content, and impaired face-to-face interactions, these arguments were more general assertions without specific evidence or solutions. They presented potential harms without adequately addressing how these risks could be mitigated through education and supervision.

The opposition's arguments were stronger because they acknowledged that social media exposure comes with risks but offered a balanced perspective that emphasized education, supervision, and responsible use rather than wholesale restriction. They presented a more realistic approach that prepares children for the digital world they will inevitably navigate.
